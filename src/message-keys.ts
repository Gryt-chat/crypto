/**
 * One key per message, wrapped once per member (GRYT-718).
 *
 * `dm-keys.ts` gives two people a shared secret. Three people do not have one,
 * and a group is what `conversations.ts` calls a conversation with `kind:
 * "group"` — so the shape here is the one GRYT-709 picked: a random key for the
 * message, encrypted once for each member with the secret the sender shares
 * with that member.
 *
 * It scales with the member cap the server already enforces rather than with
 * anything unbounded, and it needs no group ratchet, no key agreement between
 * the members themselves, and nothing kept between messages.
 *
 * ## Membership changes stop being a policy question
 *
 * `conversations.ts` worries about a message "becoming readable by a third
 * because somebody tapped add", and today it answers by refusing to turn a
 * one-to-one into a group. Here the answer is structural: somebody added
 * afterwards has no wrapped key in any message sent before they arrived, so
 * those messages stay unreadable to them. Nothing enforces that; there is
 * simply nothing for them to open.
 *
 * The reverse holds too. Removing somebody does not take back what they could
 * already read, and no design can — they had the key.
 *
 * ## What this is not
 *
 * **Not authenticated as coming from the sender.** Everyone holding the content
 * key can encrypt with it, so any member could produce a message the others
 * decrypt happily. Saying *who wrote it* is a signature with the identity key,
 * and that is not here yet.
 *
 * **Not end-to-end against the server, yet.** Wrapping to a public key is only
 * worth something if the public key belongs to who you think. That is the
 * certificate GRYT-709 describes, and until a peer can check one themselves a
 * caller is trusting the server for it. `dmSharedSecret` says the same thing
 * from the other end.
 *
 * **Not private about who is in the conversation.** The wrapped keys are listed
 * by member id, so a sealed message names its own recipients. The server that
 * stores it already stores the membership, so this gives away nothing it did
 * not have — but it does mean the ciphertext is not anonymous on its own.
 */

/*
 * The `.ts` is deliberate, and it is the only import in `src/` that carries one.
 *
 * `scripts/check-message-keys.mjs` runs this file through Node's type
 * stripping, which does no extension inference — extensionless, Node looks for
 * `dm-keys` on disk, does not find it, and the check cannot run at all. Vite and
 * `tsc` both resolve the explicit extension, and `allowImportingTsExtensions` is
 * already on in `tsconfig.app.json`.
