/**
 * The key a direct message is encrypted to (GRYT-709).
 *
 * Separate from the identity key on purpose, and not because it is tidier. The
 * identity key is ECDSA P-256, which signs and cannot do key agreement — there
 * is no operation that turns two ECDSA keys into a shared secret. Encryption
 * needs a curve built for agreement, so this is X25519 and it is a second key.
 *
 * ## Nothing secret ever leaves the device
 *
 * Only {@link dmPublicKey} is published. The private half is derived here, used
 * here, and never sent anywhere — not to the server, not encrypted, not as part
 * of a backup. A server that wanted to read a conversation would have to obtain
 * something that has never been transmitted.
 *
 * What *is* backed up is the seed, which the 24-word phrase already carries. So
 * restoring an identity restores the ability to read old messages, without
 * anything about the messages being stored anywhere but the server that already
 * has them.
 *
 * ## One key per server, like the identity key
 *
 * `identity-seed.ts` derives a separate key for each server so that two of them
 * cannot tell they are talking to the same person. That property is worth
 * exactly as much here, and would be undone by a single DM key shared across
 * servers — so the same scope goes into the derivation.
 *
 * **The scope, not the address (GRYT-719).** `identityScopeFor` gives the
 * server's lineage id, and only falls back to the address for a server that
 * proved nothing. Deriving from the address instead would give a server on a
 * LAN address and a tunnel two DM keys, and would change the key whenever a
 * port is taken or a lease moves. For the identity key that bug meant arriving
 * as a stranger, which GRYT-257 fixed and which is at least visible. Here it
 * would mean every message ever encrypted to the old key is unreadable, with
 * nothing logged. `IdentityScope` is branded so the wrong string does not
 * typecheck.
 *
 * The consequence is that a conversation is bound to the server it happens on,
 * which is what `useDirectMessages.ts` and `conversations.ts` already say about
 * DMs in plaintext. Encryption does not change the shape, it enforces it.
 *
 * ## What this file does not do
 *
 * It derives a keypair and computes a shared secret. It does not publish the
 * public key, does not encrypt a message, and does not know what a conversation
 * is. Wrapping a per-message key for each member, and the certificate that says
 * whose public key is whose, are the parts that follow — and the certificate is
 * the one that decides whether any of this is worth anything, because a shared
 * secret with a key the server chose for you protects nothing.
