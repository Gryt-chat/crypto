/**
 * What a member list does to your pins (GRYT-727).
 *
 * `peer-keys.ts` decides about one binding. This is the policy over a whole
 * list, and the policy is where the mistakes are: pinning on a change instead
 * of on a first sighting turns the design off and nothing on screen looks
 * different, and pinning your own row means a server that rewrites your key
 * gets it pinned by you.
 *
 * Here rather than in the socket package so a check can import it. The socket
 * half of GRYT-727 is one `emit` and one `then`; this is the part with
 * decisions in it, and it kept none of them within reach of a test while it
 * lived behind a Vite alias.
