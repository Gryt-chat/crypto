/**
 * Saying that a DM key and an identity key belong to the same person (GRYT-720).
 *
 * `dm-keys.ts` derives the key a message is encrypted to. Nothing says whose it
 * is, and a key handed over by a server that could have made it up is worth
 * nothing — a server that wanted to read a conversation would give each side its
 * own key and relay.
 *
 * This is one link of the chain that answers that: a short JWT, signed by the
 * per-server identity key, saying "this DM public key is mine, on this server".
 *
 * ## What it proves, exactly
 *
 * That whoever holds the identity key also chose this DM key. Nothing else. In
 * particular it does **not** say whose identity key it is — the public half
 * rides in the header, so a server can mint a keypair and sign a perfectly
 * valid binding with it.
 *
 * That is not a hole in this file, it is where the problem actually lives.
 * Nothing verifiable in band can say who a key belongs to; the regress stops at
 * something pinned earlier or something compared out of band, and at nothing
 * else. What this buys is that the two keys are now one thing to substitute
 * instead of two, and the identity key is the one the server challenged at join
 * — so a server handing out a forged binding is contradicting a proof it
 * verified itself, in front of every member at once.
 *
 * The caller pins {@link VerifiedDmKeyBinding.identityThumbprint}. That is the
 * part that means something, and `server-pins.ts` already does the same three
 * moves for server keys: pin on first sight, detect a change, refuse it.
 *
 * ## Why the key is inside the signed statement
 *
 * A server storing a DM key and a signature as two fields could serve one
 * person's key with another's signature, and a client checking them separately
 * might not notice. There is one field: the binding. The key is read out of it
 * after the signature verifies, or it is not read at all.
