/**
 * Whether a conversation can be encrypted, and doing it (GRYT-729).
 *
 * Everything underneath this has existed for a while and had no caller.
 * `sealMessage` since GRYT-718, keys published and pinned since GRYT-727. This
 * is the decision that turns them on, and it is a decision rather than a
 * capability check: it can say no, and when it says no the answer has to reach
 * the person about to press send.
 *
 * ## Every member, or nobody
 *
 * A message is sealed only when every member of the conversation has a key this
 * client is willing to use. One member without one is not a reason to seal for
 * the rest — they would be unable to read a conversation they are in, silently,
 * and the sender would have no idea.
 *
 * A member whose key *changed* counts as not having one. That is the refusal
 * from GRYT-726 arriving where it matters: nothing is encrypted to a key this
 * client has decided not to trust, and nothing falls back to plaintext without
 * saying so either.
 *
 * ## Saying no out loud
 *
 * {@link SealDecision} carries who is missing and why. A composer that quietly
 * sends in the clear because somebody has not updated their client is the exact
 * failure this whole design exists to avoid, and it is invisible from the
 * outside — the message sends, it arrives, it reads normally.
