 * The DM keypair, against the real curve library (GRYT-709).

 * Every property below is one the encryption rests on, and none of them fails
 * loudly on its own: a DM key that turned out to equal the identity key, or to
 * be the same on two servers, would encrypt and decrypt perfectly well and
 * quietly give away the thing it was supposed to protect. So they are asserted
 * rather than reasoned about.
 *
 * Runs against `@noble/curves` rather than a stub, because the one thing worth
 * knowing is that two people actually arrive at the same secret. Node 24 strips
 * the types on import.
