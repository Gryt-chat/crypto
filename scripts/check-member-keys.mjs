/**
 * What a member list does to your pins (GRYT-727).
 *
 * `peer-keys.ts` decides; this is the policy on top of it, and the policy is
 * where the mistakes are. Pinning on a change instead of on a first sighting
 * turns the whole design off and nothing on screen looks different. Pinning
 * your own row means a server that rewrites your key gets it pinned by you.
 * Neither fails loudly, so both are driven here.
 *
 * The policy is imported rather than restated. It lived in the socket package
 * behind a Vite alias at first, which Node cannot resolve, and checking it there
 * meant writing it out again here — where it would have drifted from the app
 * quietly and gone on passing. It moved to `common/auth` for that reason.
 *
 * Real WebCrypto, the real curve library, a faked `localStorage`. Node 24
 * strips the types on import.
